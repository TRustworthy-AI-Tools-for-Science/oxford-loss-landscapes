# Models Directory

This directory is intended for storing downloaded model files.

Models downloaded using `oxford-download-models` or the `download_model()` function will be stored here by default.

## Usage

```bash
# Download models to this directory
oxford-download-models --extract-dir ./models
```

Note: This directory is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing large model files to version control.
